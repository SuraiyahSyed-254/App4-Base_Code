Brief Description of Goal of Code:
Implement an alternate diagnostic app, similar to coding for the Cold or Allergies App, and add picture material.
 
Known Issues:
Will fill in when issues come up.
Ignore this error message if you see it using the javaScript console: Error with Permissions-Policy header: Origin trial controlled feature not enabled: 'interest-cohort'.
